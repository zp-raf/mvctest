License Explanations

Single licenses cover a single user or station. 
This means with one single user registration you 
can use the software with the provided homeoffice 
license keys on your laptop and home computer, 
as long as the use is not simultaneous. If 
you need to use the software simultaneously on multiple 
computers, you must buy a license for each computer.

Standard Site and var licenses cover an unlimited number of users 
at a single location of your company or organization.

Enterprise Site and var licenses cover an unlimited number 
of users within your company, school district/county, or 
organization, regardless of location or distance.

For all site licenses, the following applies: 

A "single location" is defined as the physical address (location) 
of the site license purchaser. Users who are current employees of 
the company or organization at the physical address which purchased 
the site license may use the software beyond this physical address 
(e.g. laptops) provided that at least 50% of the software use under 
the license is at the physical address which purchased the site 
license. 

A Enterprise site or var license does not have this location or 
distance restriction.
